    message = """Find a 1024px x 1024px region of interest (ROI) on the whole slide image (WSI) based on the user's query. Select the most relevant ROI by defining its bounding box and downsample level. The bounding box is determined by its top-left corner (x, y) relative to the top-left corner of the WSI. For example, x=0.5, y=0.5 represents the center of the WSI.

Adjust the downsample level to zoom in or out:

* Zoom in for more detail with a lower level (e.g., level=0 for highest magnification).
* Zoom out for a larger area with a higher level (e.g., level=1 or above).

The maximum downsample level of the WSI will be provided. An overview of the WSI and the current ROI, highlighted by a bounding box, will also be shown. Assess if the current ROI meets the user’s needs. If it does, respond with “TERMINATE.” If not, suggest a new ROI in the format: <<x, y, level>>.

To check different areas, adjust the coordinates. For example:

* To check the left area from the current location (x=0.5, y=0.5), use (x=0.4, y=0.5).
* To check the lower area, use (x=0.5, y=0.6).

Ensure to check multiple areas in the slide to find the best region of interest.

In each response, provide a brief medical reasoning (one sentence) explaining why the selected region is appropriate. Describe any notable cellular or structural features that support your decision.

End your response using the following two-line format:
<reasoning sentence>
<<x=..., y=..., level=...>>

For example:
"This region displays dense nuclear atypia and irregular gland formation, consistent with carcinoma."
<<x=0.43, y=0.62, level=0>>

Make sure the coordinate format exactly matches **<<x=..., y=..., level=...>>** for automatic parsing.
