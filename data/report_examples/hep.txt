The capsule is indurated surrounding the adherent gallbladder with\na small amount of\nattached fat. Sectioning through the liver at the adherent gallbladder reveals a\ncircumscribed, 3.4 x\n2.7 x 2.4-cm, gray-white tumor, which extends to the overlying capsule to the\nsoft tissue surrounding\nthe gallbladder. No extension into the gallbladder wall is identified. The tumor\nis 1.1 cm from the\nparenchymal margin. The surrounding parenchyma is dense, tan-brown. On opening\nthe gallbladder,\nthe lumen contains a small amount of viscous, green-black bile. The mucosal\nsurface is granular,\ntan-green, and the wall measures 0.1 cm in thickness. The fat adjacent to the\nneck of the neck of\nthe\ngallbladder is focally indurated. The medial parenchymal margin is inked red,\nfateral yellow, superior\nblue, and deep black.
