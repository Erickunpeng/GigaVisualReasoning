A smear is made. Entirely frozen on one chuck.\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:\nGLIOBLASTOMA.\nTissue submitted for frozen is subsequently submitted for permanent in one\ncassette.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nPermanent sections of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a high grade\nglial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates parenchyma. There are large areas\nof tumor necrosis, sometimes with pseudopalisading. The tumor cells resemble\nmoderately atypical fibrillary and occasionally gemistocytic astrocytes.\nMicrovascular proliferation is also seen.
