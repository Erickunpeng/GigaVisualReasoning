The appendix is not\ngrossly identified. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm in length and 4 cm in\ncircumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures\n23 in length with a circumference of 7.2 cm at the distal resected margin.\nThe intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated\nyellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to\n5.5 cm in thickness, The specimen is opened to reveal a friable, polypoid\nmass lesion measuring 5.0 cm in length and 8.0 cm in width. The mass\nis\nlocated in the large intestine, 14 cm from the proximal margin and 20 cm\nfrom the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor grossly invades\nthrough the muscularis and involves the underlying adipose tissue, and 1.5\nem from the ileocecal valve. The depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly. The\nileocecal valve is granular and markedly edematous. The remaining mucosa is\ntan-brown with the normal fords. The attached adipose tissue is submitted\nfor lymph node dissection.

TCGA-A6-3810 -\nSPECIMEN\nA. Sigmoid colon - stitch on distal and staple line at proximal end\nB. Proximal margin of sigmoid colon\nCLINICAL NOTES\nPRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left colon cancer.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\nA. The specimen is received unfixed, labeled \"sigmoid\ncolon\", and consists of a segment of large bowel,\nmeasuring\n20 cm. in length and 2.8 cm. in diameter. There is abundant\npericolonic fat and the entire specimen is up to 10 cm. in\ndiameter.\nThere is a suture at the open end of the specimen, the opposite end\nis stapled. There is an area of narrowing where an appendix\nepiploica is adherent to the serosal surface of the colon. This\narea is 6 cm. from the open end. The bowel is opened with a\nsingle\nincision on the antimesenteric surface. There is a napkin ring-\nlike\nfungating mucosal tumor, measuring 6 cm. in length and 1.2 cm. in\ndepth. The tumor is circumferential. It is 6 cm. from the distal\nmargin of resection and approximately 11 cm. from the proximal\nmargin. Sections after fixation and clearing. A portion of the\nspecimen is taken for research purposes. The fat is dissected off\nthe colon and there is an area that probably represents pericolonic\nabscess immediately adjacent to the tumor. This area might be\nassociated with diverticulum. MLM:men\nBlock summary: 1, 2 margins of resection; 3 - 7 tumor; A. 10-22\npericolonic lymph nodes.\nB. The specimen is received unfixed labeled \"proximal\nmargin of sigmoid colon\" and consists of a piece of white\nand yellow soft tissue with stapes in it. The specimen measures 4\n1 X 0.4 cm.

One\narea resembles a diverticulum with pericolonic abscess,\ndiverticulum destruction and carcinoma\n(block A7)\nAttached lymph nodes: There is no evidence of malignancy\nin any of 30 lymph nodes.\nNon-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent\npTNM Stage: T3 NO\nB. Negative for malignancy\n5, 3\nDIAGNOSIS\nA. Sigmoid colon, segmental resection:\nModerately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma\nNote: Carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria into\npericolonic soft tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy\nin any of 30 pericolonic lymph nodes.\nB.\nSigmoid colon, proximal margin, biopsy: Negative for malignancy\n"
