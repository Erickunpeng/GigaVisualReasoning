The specimen is inked. The spermatic cord is serially\nsectioned. No areas of suspicion are appreciated. Representative sections\nof the margin and additional random are sampled.\nThe tunica vaginalis is opened. it is not adherent to the white smooth\ntunica albuginea. The epididymis measures 5.5 X 1 x 0.5 cm.\nThe testicle is opened. There is a 4.9 x 3.4 X 3 cm lobulated mass that\noccupies the majority of the testicular parenchyma. Approximately 75% of\nthe mass has a firm tan-white appearance. The remainder of the mass has a\ntan, markedly soft cut surface. Within these soft areas are multiple\nfibrous strands. A representative section of each area is submitted for\nfrozen.\nINTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: \"Seminoma -\nadditional sections pending to rule out additional germ cell elements\" is\nrendered by\nThe mass extends up to but not through the tunica albuginea. It extends up\nto but does not appear to involve the rete testis.\nThe remaining testicular parenchyma is pink and slightly lobulated. The\nseminiferous tubules do not string with ease.\nThe epididymis is sectioned. The majority of the cut surfaces are pink.\nThere is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm area of orange discoloration in the head.\nRepresentative sections are submitted in 14 cassettes labeled:\n1.
