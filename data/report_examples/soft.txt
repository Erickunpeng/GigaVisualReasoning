The entire\ntumor is covered by a thin fibrous capsule and has a nodular appearance.\nThere is a segment of small bowel identified attached to one side of the\nspecimen that measures11 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. External\nsurfaces of the tumor are inked black. Possible left ureter is identified\nattached to one side of the specimen that measures 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm\nin diameter. Attached to the other side of the tumor a segment of colon is\nidentified that measures 13 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. The lumen of\nthe small bowel segment and colon are opened and no gross abnormalities are\nidentified on the mucosal surfaces. The tumor is grossly not involving the\nwall of the small bowel loop or colon. Cut surface of the tumor is tan white\ntrabeculated and firm. Focal necrosis is identified that involves less than\n10% of the tumor. Hemorrhagic foci are identified. Multiple cyst formation\nis seen. Tissue is submitted to TPS.
