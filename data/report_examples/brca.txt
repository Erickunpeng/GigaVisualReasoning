SPECIMEN
A.
Left axillary sentinel node
B.
Left breast tissue
CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer
FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A) Lymph node, left axillary sentinel node, excision - One lymph
node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1) .
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left
axillary sentinel node" are irregularly-shape fragments
of
fibroadipose tissue that measure 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm. in dimension.
Within the tissue a lymph node is identified that measures 1.6 cm.
in maximum dimension. The lymph node is bisected and frozen as AFS1
and AFS2.
B. Received fresh in a container labeled "left breast
tissue" is an 8 x 7 x 5 cm. portion of soft tan-yellow
breast tissue partially covered with a 4.5 x 2 cm. tan-pink
wrinkled
skin ellipse. There are orienting sutures present. The specimen
is
inked as follows based upon the orienting sutures: superior -
orange; anterior - blue; posterior - black; inferior - green. The
specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral. On cut surface,
there
is a 2.8 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm. tan white-pink indurated mass, which is
1.1
cm. from the nearest margin, which is the inferior posterior
margin.
The specimen away the mass consists of yellow adipose tissue with
scant interspersed tan tissue. RS-10.
BLOCK SUMMARY: B1 - medial margin; B2 - lateral margin; B3,B4 -
tumor to nearest margin (inferior/posterior) ; B5, 6 - tumor to
posterior/deep margin; 7 - superior margin; 8 - skin to tumor; 9,10
- specimen away from mass lesion.

COMMENT
Site breast, NOS C50.9 5-23-12 ed

breast tissue with needle
localization wires measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. Surgical margins are inked.
The specimen is radiographed before and after
slicing and the radiograph is reviewed by the radiologist. The specimen is
sectioned from lateral to medial aspect into seven
slices.
Slice 3 contains an ill-defined, firm tan lesion #1 containing radiological
clip. It measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. It is more than
1.0 cm from all the margins. Cut surface of slices 4 and 5 contains a second
ill-defined indurated tan lesion with clip measuring
2.0 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm. It is 0.4 cm from the closest anterior surgical margin. Cut
surface of slice 5 and 6 shows an ill-defined lesion 3
with
clip
measuring 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. In slice 5, lesion 3 and 2 are grossly connected
to each other. Lesion 3 is 0.5 cm away
from the medial surgical margin, 0.2cm from deep margin and more than 1.0 cm
from the rest of the margins. Located in fatty
tissue
at
the
inferior
aspect
of slices 1 and 2 are two possible lymph nodes ranging from 1.1 up to 1.3 cm in
