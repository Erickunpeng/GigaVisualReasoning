Multiple anthracotic hilar lymph nodes are dissected.\nRepresentative sections are\nsubmitted as follows: E1 bronchial margin, E2 vascular margin, E3-E7 largest\nmass (E3-E4 with\nvisceral and parietal pleura), E8 lower lobe parenchymal margin (yellow), E9\nuninvolved lung tissue\nbetween lower lobe mass and upper lobe nodules, E10 E12 upper lobe nodule after\ndecalcification with\nparenchymal margin (orange), E13 uninvolved lung between largest and smallest\nnodules, E14 small\nnodule totally submitted, E15 uninvolved lung, E16 fibrous adhesions, E17 lobar\nlymph nodes.\nF. Received in formalin labeled \"L9\" is an irregular shaped segment of yellow-\nblack soft tissue\nmeasuring 0.5 X 0,2 X 0.2 cm. The segments are totally submitted in formalin in\nF1.\nG. Received in formalin labeled \"granuloma contents\" is an irregular shaped\nsegment of black-white firm\ntissue measuring 1.5 X 1.5 X 0.5 cm. The segment is totally submitted in\nformalin in G1 following\ndecalcification.\nH. Received in formalin labeled \"level 12\" are two irregular shaped segments of\ntan-black soft tissue\naggregating to 2.0 X 1.0 X 0.5 cm. The segments are totally submitted in\nformalin in H1.\nPage 3 of 4\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT\nGross Description:\nI. Received in formalin labeled \"L11\" are multiple irregular segments of tan-\nbrown, soft and calcified\ntissue aggregating to 5.0 X 1.5 X 0.5 cm. The segments are totally submitted in\nformalin in I1-12. Please\nnote: 12 is following light decalcification.\nJ. Received in formalin labeled \"left lower lobe\" is an irregular shaped segment\nof brown soft tissue\nmeasuring 4.0 X 2.5 X 0.7 cm, and weighing 5.0 grams. The pleural surface is\nsoft and roughened. The\nlung parenchyma is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in\nformalin as J1-J3.\nK. Received in formalin labeled \"portion of 7th rib\" is an unoriented segment of\nbone with attached soft\ntissue measuring 8.0 X 2.0 x 0.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted in\nformalin following\ndecalcification as follows: K1 one margin, K2 opposite margin, K3-K4 addition\nrepresentative sections.\nL. Received in formalin labeled \"level 6\" are multiple irregular segments of\nyellow-black soft tissue\naggregating to 1.0 X 0.2x0.2 cm. The segments are totally submitted in formalin\nin.L1.\nM. Received in formalin labeled \"level 7\" is an irregular shaped segment of\nyellow-black soft tissue\nmeasuring 0.5 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in\nM1.\nMicroscopic:\n{Not Entered}\nPage 4 of 4\n"
