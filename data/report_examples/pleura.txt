It also involves the pleura at the diaphragmatic\nsurface and is adherent to the diaphragm. It slightly and focally infiltrate\nthe skeletal muscle. Medially, the pleura is also involved with tumor and it\ninvolves the adherent parietal pericardium. The tumor appears solid, made up\nof masses of polygonal cells and spindle cells with desmoplasia and marked\nchronic inflammation with areas of necrosis. There focal areas of papillary\npattern. The tumor focally infiltrates into the lung parenchyma. The\ninterlobar pleura is also involved and also here the tumor infiltrates into the\n-\nlung parenchyma. The lung parenchyma shows edema, acute and chronic passive\ncongestion, focal scattered chronic pneumonitis and moderate sclerosis of\nvessels. No thrombi are identified in the small and large vessels. Several\nlymph nodes are identified and are all negative for metastatic tumor. The\nnodes show sinus histiocytosis, congestion, anthracotic pigmentation and\nreactive follicular hyperplasia. The bronchial margin of resection is negative\nfor tumor.\nImmunostains for the tumor cells are done on two blocks to include:\nkeratin- positive; vimentin-positive; calretinin-positive; CK5/6-positive;\nBER EP4- negative; B72.3- negative; CEA- negative; $100-negative, and\nITF-1-negative.

Received fresh, labeled left lung, is a 1,790 gm left pneumonectomy specimen\nthat measures 30.0 x 23.8 x 8.0 cm, overall. The specimen includes the entire\nleft lung and has an attached portion of diaphragm and pericardium. The\npericardium is 12.0 x 1.5 cm and has a gray-pink, smooth, glistening surface.\nThe diaphragm is 23.0 x 14.5 x 2.0 cm. The surgical resection margin\nsurrounding the diaphragm and pericardium are inked black. The bronchial\nmargin and vessel margin at the hilum, are taken and upon opening of both the\nbronchi and vessels, all are unremarkable. Eight (8) hilar lymph nodes are\nidentified, ranging from 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm up to 1. x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. Upon\ndissection, some of the larger lymph nodes have a dark-black to gray, smooth,\nglistening cut surface. The parietal pleura is red-pink, smooth and upon\npalpation is indurated in some areas. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a\ngray-white, firm rim of tumor, extending into the lung parenchyma and involving\nthe pericardium and part of the diaphragm. The tumor occupies 30% of the lung,\nranges from 0. cm up to 8.5 cm in thickness. The interlobar fissure is\ninvolved and obliterated. The inferior aspect of the lung is remarkable for a\n1.5 cm cavity, containing a clear fluid and is lined by dusky, soft, necrotic\nmaterial. The uninvolved diaphragm is red and soft. The uninvolved lung\nparenchyma is red, soft and spongy. Representative sections are submitted in 32\ncassettes.\nSection summary:\n1-2 tumor with diaphragm\n3- tumor with pericardium\n4- tumor with pleura\n5- bronchial margin\n6- artery margin\n7- vein margin\n8-12 tumor with pericardium (#12 includes diaphragm)\n13-17 tumor with diaphragm (#15 includes visceral pleura; 16-17 - include\ncavity)\n18- tumor with parietal pleura\n19-20 tumor with intralobar fissure\n21- tumor with pleura\n22-24 tumor with lung parenchyma (#22 includes hilar nodes)\n25- two lymph nodes\n26- two lymph nodes\n27- half of one bisected lymph node\n28- other half of one hisected lymph node\n29-31- one bisected lymph node, each\n32- viscera, parietal pleura with tumor and lung parenchyma.\nNOTE: Additional sections consisting of the tumor with pleural surface is\nsubmitted in cassettes add 1-5.\nB.

Received fresh, labeled mediastinal fat, is a 4.3 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm soft,\nlobulated portion of adipose tissue. Dissection reveals six (6) possible lymph\nnodes, ranging from 0.4 cm up to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Two (2) of the lymph\nnodes are sectioned to reveal purple-pink, smooth and glistening cut surfaces.\nLymph nodes are entirely submitted in 3 cassettes labeled C, as follows:\n1- one bisected lymph node\n2- two possible lymph node\n3- three lymph nodes.\nD. Received fresh, labeled bronchial margin, is a pink-yellow, rubbery tubular\nstructure, consistent with portion of bronchus which is 2.1 cm in length and\n1.7 cm in diameter.
